What is the use of money today?
It's the middleman in the transfer of value. It's the tool that helps us exchange value. In the history of humanity, from the oldest civilizations we can track, various technologies of money existed to help us exchange value. The most common ones are gold, silver, and paper money. The most recent one is digital money.
At the end of the day however humans want to trade value. They have certain goals, certain experiences they want to have. But we need money to do that. We need money to live our dreams, to live our goals.
You can take anything that happens to for example. 
Why does someone go to work?
So that they can earn money to maybe buy a house, to buy a car, to go on a vacation, to buy a new phone, to feel new experiences. They are transfering their value to the company. The company in turns pays them how much they feel you are worth. You then use that money to exchange it for someone else's value creation.

The following diagram shows us the evolution of money.
