What is the use of money today?
It's the middleman in the transfer of value. It's the tool that helps us exchange value. In the history of humanity, from the oldest civilizations we can track, various technologies of money existed to help us exchange value. The most common ones are gold, silver, and paper money. The most recent one is digital money.
At the end of the day however humans want to trade value. They have certain goals, certain experiences they want to have. But we need money to do that. We need money to live our dreams, to live our goals.
You can take anything that happens to for example. 
Why does someone go to work?
So that they can earn money to maybe buy a house, to buy a car, to go on a vacation, to buy a new phone, to feel new experiences. They are transfering their value to the company. The company in turns pays them how much they feel you are worth. You then use that money to exchange it for someone else's value creation.

The following diagram shows us the evolution of money.

Bitcoin is the latest evolution in the technology of money. It showed us that everyone who uses this protocol can reach consensus on who owns what. There is no need of any centralised authority to verify the same. This removes the unnecessary complications that comes with trust and centralised institutions altogether.
This technological innovation showed us that we can all reach consensus about some information. This is the technology that we will use to build this protocol.

The core principle applied in this protocol is as follows:
Between any interaction, the users will measure if they feel the interaction added value to them or not.

Whenever any interaction happens, the users who are providing the value can stake how many of their tokens they think they deserve to add.

Everyone uses a protocol for every aspect in their lives. Their total value will be the value they created plus the values of all the protocols tokens they have collected in their daily lives. The protocols they believe in. It's the job of the protocol to sell to their users why they should use it.

If a user uses your token, it means they believe in your protocol, they believe in you.

Collecting the right protocols means you are increasing your value the right way. Protocols are a good way to incentivise a user to do something. You can have different protocols created for every aspect in life. Token distribution will be done to those users who follow the protocol. Checks will be written in smart contracts. This way we can ensure a user is following the protocol or not.

You can circulate your tokens in things that you believe in. For example, for content creators, they can incentivize people in collecting their tokens by selling themselves and their ideas. If I believe that someone is doing something that adds value, then I am incentivised to collect their tokens as my value increases too.

### How do we assign a number to this value?
The more the people that collect your tokens, the more your value increases. 

## Interactions

There are many type of interactions. Let's start with the most basic of types of interaction. Alice provides a service that Bob wants.

![Basic Interaction](https://github.com/AireshBhat/TransferOfValue/blob/main/assets/BasicInteraction.png)

Once Alice provides the service, Bob can either state whether the service added value to him or not. If yes, we can conclude that Alice's value increases. If not, it decreases.

Let the total value of knowledge by 10000.
Alice: 700
Bob: 300

All users will have their tokens in circulation. 

Tokens in hand:
Alice: 10000
Bob: 10000

Therefore each Alice token is worth 0.07 and each Bob token is worth 0.03.

If Alice provides a service for 10A tokens, Bob will need to exchange 23B of his tokens to get the service.
Alice stakes 10A tokens into the service and Bob stakes 23B tokens into the service.
