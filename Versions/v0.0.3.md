From the oldest civilization of humanity till date, we humans have used various technologies to exchange value.

The following diagram shows us the evolution of money.

At the end of the day it all boils down to the experiences we have and want to have. Money is just the medium through which we do it.

Bitcoin is the latest evolution in the technology of money. It showed us that everyone who uses this protocol can reach consensus on who owns what. There is no need of any centralised authority to verify the same. This removes the unnecessary complications that comes with trust and centralised institutions altogether.
This technological innovation showed us that we can all reach consensus about some information. This is the technology that we will use to build this protocol.

The protocol we are building will start as a wallet protocol. It will then grow as a tool that helps everyone achieve their goals and experiences.

The wallet will measure the value each wallet user has added. This will be measured by the number of different tokens under the wallet address is spread.

Everyone uses a protocol for every aspect in their lives. Their total value will be the value they created plus the values of all the protocols tokens they have collected and added in their daily lives. The protocols they believe in. It's the job of the protocol to sell to their users why they should use it.

If a user uses your token, it means they believe in your protocol, they believe in you.

Collecting the right protocols means you are increasing your value. Having the most wanted protocols is a great way to increase your wallets and in turn your value. Protocols are a good way to incentivise a user to do something. You can have different protocols created for every aspect in life. Token distribution will be done to those users who follow the protocol. Checks will be written in smart contracts. This way we can ensure a user is following the protocol or not.

You can circulate your tokens in things that you believe in. For example, for content creators, they can incentivize people in collecting their tokens by selling themselves and their ideas. If I believe that someone is doing something that adds value, then I am incentivised to collect their tokens as my value increases too.

### How do we assign a number to this value?
The more the people that collect your tokens, the more your value increases.
The algorithm used to calculate the wallets value will be written in the smart contract. This can be updated as and when the DAO(which is nothing but all the users of the wallet) votes for a change. Which protocols to add in the calculation will probably be the main topic of discussion in this DAO.
Initial protocols to be added in the calculation will be the ones used to build this wallet. Whoever activates this wallet will get all the protocol tokens used by default. This will be the incentive for a user to get a wallet.

### The DeFi of tomorrow? What happens to all the money?
Existing fiat currencies will be used to fuel this protocol. At the end of the day, it's not about the money right. It's about the values we share. As and when people realise this fact, they will start pumping money into this protocol. It's like WOM(Word of Mouth protocol) but on a more basic level. The DeFi of tomorrow will track those wallets who are adding the most value. These wallets will be given a CHIT token. This is the incentive token of the wallet protocol. Having a CHIT token is like having a golden ticket. Having a CHIT token will give you unlimited access to everything this web3 universe can offer you. All these tools for free. It's the freedom to explore your passion. The freedom to have fun with your friends. The freedom to build together as a community. The freedom to cause a change. The freedom to save the planet. You can access all these tools to make a change you never thought you could possibly do. This is what the CHIT token will offer you. You'll also get access to all the events and fests we conduct! It's like heaven on Earth XD.

CHIT token will also be used to incentivize developers to contribute to this ecosystem. If allowed, it can also be used to stake for ethereum which can be used as the currency of tomorrow. It's however better if we don't have "money" and focus on distributing protocol tokens instead. We can however use it to reach this final state.

### What are we building?
A wallet. A user profile. A dashboard. A drawing board. Actually, just a wallet, but with all these as plugins! A wallet is something that will keep track of the value added by the user. At the same time, it acts as a tool the user could use to help him provide more value.
Head over to the wallet docs to understand more about what goes into building it.

### How the word of mouth would ideally grow?
First protocols will be created by those who teach. For completing courses with written checks in smart contracts will be the first rules for protocols to earn their tokens. The most important job right now is to educate this world about the freedom they possess and the ability to build their future using web3 technology. Explaining why owning your data means owning your technology will be the first lesson everyone would have to come to consensus to. This can be done via teaching and can be spread even faster through community driven fests, NGOs and community startups. I think a good idea as to how things may turn out technologically would be written in the book "Network States" by *Balaji Srinivasan*.
These wallets will then be used to hire builders who are passionate about their projects. They will be in turn rewarded with tokens and other value added benefits this web3 world can offer you. Those companies who offer both best in value and passionate work will be the biggest token distributers of tomorrow. You can think of blockchain and the web3 community as the role "Apple" plays in our lives today. But this time, it's accessible to everyone.
