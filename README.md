# Executive Summary:

What is the use of money today?
It's the middleman in the transfer of value. It's the tool that helps us exchange value. In the history of humanity, from the oldest civilizations we can track, various technologies of money existed to help us exchange value. The most common ones are gold, silver, and paper money. The most recent one is digital money.
At the end of the day however humans want to trade value. They have certain goals, certain experiences they want to have. But we need money to do that. We need money to live our dreams, to live our goals.
You can take anything that happens to for example. 
Why does someone go to work?
So that they can earn money to maybe buy a house, to buy a car, to go on a vacation, to buy a new phone, to feel new experiences. They are transfering their value to the company. The company in turns pays them how much they feel you are worth. You then use that money to exchange it for someone else's value creation.

The following diagram shows us the evolution of money.

Bitcoin is the latest evolution in the technology of money. It showed us that everyone who uses this protocol can reach consensus on who owns what. There is no need of any centralised authority to verify the same. This removes the unnecessary complications that comes with trust and centralised institutions altogether.
This technological innovation showed us that we can all reach consensus about some information. This is the technology that we will use to build this protocol.

The core principle applied in this protocol is as follows:
Between any interaction, the users will measure if they feel the interaction added value to them or not.

Whenever any interaction happens, the users who are providing the value can stake how many of their tokens they think they deserve to add.

There are many type of interactions. Let's start with the most basic of types of interaction. Alice provides a service that Bob wants.

![Basic Interaction](https://github.com/AireshBhat/BasicInteraction/blob/main/assets/BasicInteraction.png)

Once Alice provides the service, Bob can either state whether the service added value to him or not. If yes, we can conclude that Alice's value increases. If not, it decreases.

Let the total value of knowledge by 10000.
Alice: 700
Bob: 300

All users will have their tokens in circulation. 

Tokens in hand:
Alice: 10000
Bob: 10000

Therefore each Alice token is worth 0.07 and each Bob token is worth 0.03.

If Alice provides a service for 10A tokens, Bob will need to exchange 23B of his tokens to get the service.
Alice stakes 10A tokens into the service and Bob stakes 23B tokens into the service.
